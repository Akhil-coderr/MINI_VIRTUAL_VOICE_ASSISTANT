# The First Tech Project

Welcome to **The First Tech Project** – a voice assistant built using Python!

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project is my first step into the world of AI-powered voice assistants. 
It can respond to voice commands, provide answers, and interact like a friendly virtual helper.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time voice recognition
- Text-to-speech responses
- Customizable prompts
- Friendly and efficient conversation style
- Modular structure for future updates

## 📁 Project Structure
agent.py: Main file that runs the voice assistant

prompt.py: Contains the prompt for instructions and response formatting

requirements.txt: Lists all required Python packages

.env: Stores environment variables securely

venv/: Your virtual environment
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create and activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the assistant:
python agent.py

As this was my first project so this is a raw model of how to create a user friendly voice assistant using livekit and google llm,
you can run this mini assistant in the console or in the cloud server of livekit which is free by usinng the command i pasted inside the last lines of agent.py where you can select the command and run it on the terminal then it may  link to the cloud of livekit server 

 Future Plans
Add new tools and voices

Build a GUI or app interface

Deploy on mobile or desktop
